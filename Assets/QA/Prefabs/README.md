Prefabs must be added as a child of the Canvas GameObject.

If there is no Canvas GameObject in the Scene, create one through UI/Canvas.
Creating a Canvas GameObject should also create an EventSystem GameObject.

Drag and Drop the Prefab on the Canvas GameObject.
Rename this new instance to the Property it will be attached to.
